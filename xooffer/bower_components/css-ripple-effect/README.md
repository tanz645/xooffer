# Pure CSS ripple effect (no JavaScript)

## CSS-only implementation of Android Material design "ripple" animation on click event

Main advantage of this solution is that there is no DOM manipulation in order to create animation. That means this is faster - it doesn't use JavaScript or jQuery to animate.
